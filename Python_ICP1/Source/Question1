1) Print Statement:
   In Python2, Print is a statement rather than a function.
   In Python3, Print statement is a built-in function where the text is enclosed in the parenthesis.
2) String type:
   In Python2, ASCII format is the default string type.
   In Python3, Unicode format is the default string type
3)Division Arithmetic Operation:
   In Python2, division operation gives you the nearest whole number.
   In Python3, division operation gives you the expected result.
4)Iteration:
